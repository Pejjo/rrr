# RRR HTTP WEBSOCKET SERVER

## Introduction

A HTTP server processes request from clients and generates responses.
In this example, a web browser opens up a Websocket connection to the RRR HTTP server.
A Websocket connections starts out as a normal HTTP connection which is then upgraded to exchange Websocket frames.

Before trying out this example, you might want to look at a [simpler RRR HTTP-server configuration](http_server.md).

## Application

* Asynchronus messages to and from web browsers using Websocket technique

## Configuration

The configuration uses the **httpserver** and **perl5** modules. The HTTP server negotiates websocket
with the web browsers. Messages received from the browser is sent to the **perl5** module, and the 
**perl5** module periodically generates messages for the browsers currently connected.

A unique ID for every HTTP connection is used internally in RRR to distinguish the browsers from each other.

The particular files used to run example are somewhat large, open them using these links:

* [http\_websocket.conf](http_websocket.conf) - RRR configuration file
* [http\_websocket.pl](http_websocket.pl) - The Perl script which handles and generates Websocket frames
* [http\_websocket.html](http_websocket.html) - An HTML file to open in a browser which creates a Websocket connection

The setup consists of four parts:

* **httpserver** handles HTTP connections at a low-level (just parses and forwards data)
* **perl5**
  * Keeps track of open connections and their handle IDSs
  * Saves the last received message from each clients
  * Runs its `source` subroutine on a regular basis and sends back the last received message
* A **browser** runs a Javascript which ensures that a Websocket connection to the server is always open

How it works:

* The `http_server_websocket_topic_filters=#` parameter in the configuration tells the HTTP server to allow Websocket connection upgrades on client request, regardless of the URL used (but the endpoint in the URL may not be empty).
* The **httpserver** and **perl5** modules are set up to read messages from each other.
* The client (run by the browser) uses a Javascript to connect to the RRR HTTP server. Whenever a connection is complete, it reconnects.
* The client sends 'alive' messages periodically. The Perl5 script receives this and identifies that a connection is open.
* The Perl5 scripts sends a message back to the client every two seconds

## Run the example

This example requires having one terminal window and a browser open.

* In the browser, open the HTML file from locally on the filesystem (using an URL like `file:///home/...../http_websocket.html`)
* In the first terminal, run RRR from inside the `examples/http`-directory. The Perl5 script will print some information about messages being received and generated without any debuglevel being active.

	``$Â rrr http_websocket.conf``

* If the HTML file is opened in the browser prior to the RRR web server being started, the browser might wait a bit before it tries to reconnect.
* When the browser has connected, a green box will appear confirming that a websocket connection has been initiated.
* The client will begin to send 'alive' messages over the Websocket connection, which triggers the Perl5 script to send messages back containing the data from the last received message.
* All messages received will be logged in the message box
* Custom messages can be sent over the Websocket connection by using the provided input form
* If a browser is disconnected, the Perl5 script eventually detects that no messages is being sent from the browser, and it stops generating messages.

## Notes

By allowing long-lived connections, the HTTP server becomes vulnerable to **Denial of Service** attacks. Use on closed networks only. To allow
more simultaneous connections, increase the number of running threads with the parameter `http_server_worker_threads`. There is a minor CPU penalty by
having many threads running.

The Python module can be used instead of the Perl5 module to process Websocket messages.
