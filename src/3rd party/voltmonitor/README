If you want to compile 'checkvoltage' from source by yourself just type:
gcc checkvoltage.c -o checkvoltage -lusb

To download the needed usb development files (ubuntu and debian):
sudo apt-get install libusb-dev

To start the voltage monitoring script:
./measure-voltage  path_to_working_dir [path_to_storage_dir]

If 'path_to_storage_dir' is not given the 'working_dir' is used for storage

If you want to have some quick example images you can use the database
out of the folder 'example':

voltages.db
