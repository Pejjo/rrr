# README FOR VOLTAGE LOGGER
## ABOUT

Voltage logger is designed to read data from sensors and logging it in a threaded and
buffered fashion, ensuring that no measurement is lost due to IO problems. Data is
routed between custom modules by having "senders" specified for some of them, instructing
them who to read from. Source modules should have a buffer which they write to
independently from their readers. A buffer implementation is included.

## USAGE

Two test modules are provided, `dummy` and `raw`. Dummy is a source module who writes
messages to a buffer at fixed intervals. The `raw` module simply reads from the buffer,
clears it and dumps the data on the screen.

To start the program with these to modules with `raw` reading from `dummy`, run:

`vlogger module=raw,dummy`

To start the program with `raw` reading from two modules:

`vlogger module=raw,custom1,custom2`

To start a chain with three modules `custom1->raw->custom2`:

`vlogger module=raw,custom1 module=custom2,raw`

A module can also be specified on its own:

`vlogger module=custom3`

## MODULE SPECIFIC ARGUMENTS

### voltmonitor (USB voltmeter driver)

`vlogger module=voltmonitor,raw vm_calibration=1.020 vm_channel=2`

Specifiy channel (1 or 2) and/or calibration (factor which scales input).
