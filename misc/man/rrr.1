.TH RRR 1
.SH NAME
Read Route Record is a dynamic module-based message handling program
for collecting, buffering, processing and storing messages and measurements.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rrr
.OP config={file}
.OP debuglevel=num
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B rrr
environment is set up with a configuration file. The file specifies any number
of
.B instances
of different
.B modules.
The different instances either get messages from other
modules or read them externally. Some also save messages externally or
send them over the network.
.PP
.B rrr
may be extended with custom modules. Custom functionality may also be achieved by
using a module which can send data to and from a python program.
.PP
.B rrr
automatically restarts all running instances in case one instance for any
reason stops or hangs, like due to network problems. A failing instance
usually does not make
.B rrr
quit, all instances are simply restarted.
.PP
.SH RETURN VALUE
.B rrr
returns 0 on success and 1 on failure.
.SH DEBUG
A debuglevel may be specified at command line making
.B rrr
print different debug information.
By default, only errors are printed.
The debuglevel is calculated by adding any of the following numbers together:
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It 1
Info about loading and closing of modules and threads (low rate)
.It 2
Runtime information in modules, they tell what they do at (high rate)
.It 4
Some data debugging is printed (high rate)
.It 8
Debug locking, thread states and buffers (very high rate)
.It 16
Alive-messages from some threads to see if they freeze (very high rate)
.It 32
Debug hex prints (large outputs)
